# 🛒 Sales Forecasting for Retail Business

This project focuses on building a **Sales Forecasting** model using real-world retail data. The goal is to predict future sales trends and support better business decision-making through time series analysis and regression modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Internship-based project focused on forecasting sales in a retail environment
- Used time series and regression models to analyze trends, seasonality, and key performance metrics
- Delivered insights to help optimize inventory planning and marketing strategies

## 🔍 Key Steps

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect trends and seasonality
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data
- Built forecasting models using **Facebook Prophet**
- Applied **regression techniques** using Scikit-learn
- Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE
- Visualized sales trends and category-wise performance

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
